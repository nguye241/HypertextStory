            <p>I was walking with my cousin, talking like usual, then suddenly I felt something like a cold hand grabbed my left shoulder.</p>
            <p>I looked back.</p>
            <p>There was no one there.</p>
            <p>I ignored it, thinking it was just my imagination. But then, it happened again, and I heard a faint voice calling my name.</p>
            <p>I turned to my cousin and asked "Did you say something?"</p>
            <p>She didn't.</p>
