        <p>It was Lunar New Year in Vietnam a few years ago, I went to a famous pagoda/temple to pray with my relatives.</p>
        <p>After my cousin and I were done praying, we decided to walk around the yard looking around and admiring Buddist scultures. They were very grand and majestic, I could see the monks take very good care of this place.</p>
        <p>We were walking for about ten minutes until we reached a small praying area with a smaller temple.</p>
        <p>The place was built in a small courtyard a little bit far away from the main yard, we decided to pray there as well, for New Year's good luck.</p>
        <p>After we were done with praying (again), on our way back to the main yard, we walked past a pretty big tree. That was the moment when *that* happened.</p>
        <p>I was walking with my cousin, talking like usual, then suddenly I felt something like a cold hand grabbed my left shoulder.</p>
        <p>I looked back.</p>
        <p>There was no one there.</p>
        <p>I ignored it, thinking it was just my imagination. But then, it happened again, and I heard a faint voice calling my name.</p>
        <p>I turned to my cousin and asked "Did you say something?"</p>
        <p>She didn't.</p>
        <p>To be honest, I do not believe in the paranormal, but I did feel weird and freaked out a bit.</p>
        <p>"We should go back, quick." I said to my cousin.</p>
        <p>We walked away from there, and our lives were back to normal.</p>
        <p>However, I still think about that moment sometimes, and I still can't explain what happened there.</p>
        <p>And that was a brief spooky moment in my life, so far.</p>
