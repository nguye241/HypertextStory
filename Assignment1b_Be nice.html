    <div>This is a very random and unorganized rant, just my random thoughts on being nice to people.</div>

    <p>I am a digital artist who is lucky enough to build a small community of people that appreciate my silly artwork. It was just a fun hobby that I decided to share with some people online who might enjoy the same media.</p>
    <p>At first, I was sharing my silly doodles randomly, no one saw them but this little hobby makes me happy, since I love drawing.</p>
    <p>But then some people who eventually saw them, liked them and commented "I love your art, it makes me feel happy."</p>
    <p>After reading that comment, I felt warm inside, I felt happy, since I never expected my silly hobby can make someone's day. They are just silly drawings, but it can make someone smiles.</p>
    <p>That was an online interaction. What about real life?</p>
    <p>We all have one of those days, where we feel gloomy, cranky and just want to be alone. Sometimes we feel like the world hates us and everything just feels empty.</p>
    <p>But it's not.</p>
    <p>We have come across many people in our lives, and of course we don't get along and like every single person we meet.</p>
    <p>But we don't have to make it a negative thing, we don't have to spend time with people we don't get along and think that everyone is like that.</p>
    <p>Let's be brave and maybe say hi or ask someone who was waiting for the bus with you how their day is going so far. Try to meet new people.</p>
    <p>Maybe they were having one of those days, but a simple gesture of caring might improve their day, might not be a lot, but just a little bit, and sometimes just a little bit is enough.</p>
    <p>Just relax yourself a bit, a random nice gesture won't hurt. I promise.</p>
